- An IDE like **Microsoft Visal Studio Code**
- **Datasets** containing the required details

## The datasets

The Dataset have _nine (**9**)_ colums in this order:

- Unique ID (format: 5688089)
- Start Time (format: 2017-06-11 14:55:05)

- End Station (format: W Broadway & Spring St)  
- User Type (format: Subscriber)  
- Gender (format: Male)  
- Birth Year (format: 1998.0)  

### These are already prepared as data sources in the code:  
   - chicago.csv  
   - new_york_city.csv  
   - washington.csv  

## What insights can you gain from the data?

   - most common month, day of week or hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip:  

   - most common start station or end station, from to

3. Trip duration:  

   - total travel time or average travel time

4. Infos about the Users

   - User Type,Gender or Birth Year
